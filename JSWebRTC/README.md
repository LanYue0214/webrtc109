# WebRTC

## Introduction
With the advancement of technology and the rapid development of the Internet in recent years, the way people communicate with each other has changed dramatically. Nowadays, although we can make calls and videos over the Internet, they can be delayed by various factors, so we hope to reduce the delay rate and achieve real-time communication through WebRTC (Web Real Time Connection).
